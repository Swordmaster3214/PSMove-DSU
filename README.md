# PSMove-DSU

A cross-platform DSU (DualShock UDP) / Cemuhook server for PlayStation Move controllers, enabling motion controls in games and emulators that support the DSU protocol.

## Overview

PSMove-DSU bridges PlayStation Move controllers to applications that support the DSU/Cemuhook protocol, such as:
- **Cemu** (Wii U emulator)
- **Dolphin** (GameCube/Wii emulator)
- **RPCS3** (PS3 emulator)
- **Yuzu** (Nintendo Switch emulator)
- **PCSX2** (PS2 emulator)
- Any application supporting motion controls via DSU

The server translates PS Move controller input (accelerometer, gyroscope, and buttons) into the standardized DSU protocol, allowing these controllers to provide motion control functionality in supported games.

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Real-time motion data**: Accelerometer and gyroscope
- **Button support**: All PS Move controller buttons
- **DSU/Cemuhook protocol**: Compatible with all DSU-enabled applications
- **Automatic controller detection**: Plug and play functionality

## Quick Start

### Using Pre-built Binaries

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform:
   - [Windows](https://github.com/Swordmaster3214/PSMove-DSU/releases/latest/)
   - [macOS](https://github.com/Swordmaster3214/PSMove-DSU/releases/latest/)
   - [Linux](https://github.com/Swordmaster3214/PSMove-DSU/releases/latest/)

2. **Connect your PS Move controller** via Bluetooth

3. **Run the executable**:
   #### Windows
   ```bash
   ./dsu_server_psmove_windows_win64.exe
   ```
   #### macOS/Linux
   ```bash
   ./dsu_server_psmove_macos_x64
   ```
   ```bash
   ./dsu_server_psmove_linux_x64
   ```

5. **Configure your emulator** to connect to `127.0.0.1:26760` (default DSU port)

### Button Mappings

Button | Mapping
--- | ---
X | Cross
O | Circle
â–¡ | Square
âˆ† | Triangle
Move | R1
SELECT | Share
START | Options
T | R2
PS | PS

### Controller Setup

#### Bluetooth Pairing
**Note:** You will not need to do the following if you have already paired your controller with your computer using [PSMoveAPI](https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi)
```bash
./dsu_server_psmove --pair
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

#### All Platforms
- **CMake** 3.10 or higher
- **C++ compiler** with C++17 support
- **PSMoveAPI 4.0.12** [downloaded](https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi/releases/latest/)

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libbluetooth-dev pkg-config
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install libusb
```

#### Windows
- Visual Studio 2017 or higher
- Windows SDK

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swordmaster3214/PSMove-DSU.git && cd PSMove-DSU
   ```

2. **Create build directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. **Configure with CMake**:
   #### Linux/macOS
   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPSMOVE_ROOT=/path/to/psmoveapi ..
   ```
   #### Windows
   ```bash
   cmake -DPSMOVE_ROOT=/path/to/psmoveapi ..
   ```

5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

6. **Run the executable**:
   The executable will be in the build directory
   ```bash
   ./dsu_server_psmove
   ```

### Custom PSMoveAPI Location

If you have PSMoveAPI installed in a custom location:

```bash
cmake -DPSMOVE_ROOT=/path/to/psmoveapi ..
```
## Configuration

### DSU Server Settings
The server runs on `127.0.0.1:26760` by default, which is the standard DSU port. Most applications will automatically detect the server at this address.

### Emulator Setup

#### Cemu
1. Go to **Options** â†’ **GamePad Motion Source** â†’ **DSU1**
2. Set server IP to `127.0.0.1` and port to `26760`

#### Dolphin
1. Go to **Controllers** â†’ **Configure** â†’ **Motion Input**
2. Set source to **DSU** with server `127.0.0.1:26760`

#### Yuzu
1. Go to **Configure** â†’ **Controls** â†’ **Advanced**
2. Enable **Motion** and set to **DSU** with `127.0.0.1:26760`

## Troubleshooting

### Controller Not Detected
- Ensure the PS Move controller is properly paired
- On Linux, you may need to run with `sudo` for USB access permissions
- Check that no other applications are using the controller

### Connection Issues
- Verify the server is running and listening on port 26760
- Check firewall settings if connecting from another machine
- Ensure the emulator is configured with the correct IP and port

### Build Issues
- Make sure all dependencies are installed
- Verify CMake version is 3.10 or higher
- On Windows, ensure you're using the correct Visual Studio toolchain

### Linux Permissions
If you get permission errors accessing the controller:
Add udev rules for PS Move controller
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
```
Log out and back in for changes to take effect
